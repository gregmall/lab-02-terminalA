# This is how its done
## First create a directory _src_ 

### Inside _src_ create a nested directory named **assets**
- do this by typing __mkdir 
~/src/assets
also create a file in directory src by typing touch index.html
###  create 2 files in the directory assets with the following names: 
- style.css
+ app.js
##### this is done by going to the assets directory (type cd ~/src/assets) and the using the **touch** command to create the files.
1.  touch style.css
1.  touch app.js



*do this by typing __touch style.css and touch app.js__ while in directory /assets*

## Lets head back to the initial directory, *lab-02-terminalA* (type cd ../..)
create a file named instuctions by typing "touch instructions.md"

## Now we are going to create another file in the alchemy directory named greeting.md but we are going to assign a string value.  The following table will show the directory, file name, and the string assigned to it:

|  Directory |  File Name | String  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  lab-02-terminalA |  greeting.md |  Hello there! |

since we are already in the lab-02-terminalA directory we can do this by simply typing **echo "Hello there!" > greeting.md**
